# Decorators
Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python.Because it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of a function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

Thanks to Miuul Extras, I have grasped the concept of decorator in python!
